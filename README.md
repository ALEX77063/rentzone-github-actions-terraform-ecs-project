      ```bash
      aws configure
      ```

## Repository Setup

1. **Creating a GitHub Repository**
   - Create a new GitHub repository for your project.

2. **Cloning the Repository**
   - Clone the repository on your computer:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
     ```

3. **Adding Terraform Code**
   - Add your Terraform files to the repository.

4. **Create S3 Bucket for Terraform State**
   - Use Terraform to provision an S3 bucket.

5. **Create DynamoDB Table for Locks**
   - Create a DynamoDB table to manage state locks.

6. **Creating Secrets in AWS Secrets Manager**
   - Store sensitive information using AWS Secrets Manager.

7. **Registering Domain Name in Route 53**
   - Use Route 53 to register your domain.

8. **Updating Terraform Backend**
   - Configure the Terraform backend with the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table.

9. **Fill Out `terraform.tfvars`**
   - Provide values for your Terraform variables inside `terraform.tfvars`.

10. **Run Terraform Apply**
   - Test your Terraform code:
      ```bash
      terraform apply
      ```

## GitHub Actions Configuration

1. **Creating Personal Access Token**
   - Generate a Personal Access Token in GitHub settings.

2. **Creating GitHub Repository Secrets**
   - Add secrets to your GitHub repository for sensitive data.

3. **Creating GitHub Actions Workflow File**
   - Set up your workflow YAML file in `.github/workflows/`.

4. **Configuring AWS Credentials Job**
   - Add a job to configure AWS credentials within GitHub Actions.

5. **Deploy AWS Infrastructure Job**
   - Create a job that runs `terraform apply`.

6. **Destroy Infrastructure Job**
   - Create a job that cleans up resources.

7. **Creating ECR Repository Job**
   - Implement a job to create an Amazon ECR repository.

8. **Windows Users Key Pair**
   - Provide instructions for Windows users to generate key pairs, if necessary.

9. **Launching EC2 Instance**
   - Launch an EC2 instance using Terraform or AWS CLI.

10. **SSH into EC2 Instance**
    - Connect to your instance with SSH:
      ```bash
      ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-public-ip
      ```

11. **Installing Docker and Git on EC2**
    - Install required software on the EC2 instance
    - Creating an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**
   - Launch an EC2 instance and configure it.
   - Create an AMI from the configured instance.

2. **Terminating the EC2 Instance**
   - After creating the AMI, safely terminate the EC2 instance.

## GitHub Actions Configuration

3. **Creating a Self-Hosted Runner**
   - Navigate to your GitHub repository settings and follow the instructions to add a self-hosted runner.

4. **Creating a Repository for Application Code**
   - Create a new GitHub repository to store your application code.

5. **Adding the Application Code**
   - Add your application source code to the newly created GitHub repository.

6. **Creating the Dockerfile**
   - In the root of your application repository, create a `Dockerfile` to define how to build your Docker image.

7. **Creating `AppServiceProvider.php`**
   - Add the `AppServiceProvider.php` file to your application code. This file typically contains application service container bindings.

## GitHub Actions Jobs

8. **Building and Pushing Docker Image to ECR**
   - Create a GitHub Actions job defined in your workflow file to build the Docker image and push it to Amazon ECR. Example:
   ```yaml
   jobs:
     build:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
       - name: Checkout code
         uses: actions/checkout@v2
       - name: Setup Docker Buildx
         uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1
       - name: Login to Amazon ECR
         uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v1
       - name: Build and push Docker image
         uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
         with:
           context: .
           push: true
           tags: <YOUR_ECR_URI>:latest
   Create a GitHub Actions job to export environment variables into an S3 bucket. Use AWS CLI commands within the job:
   name: Export Env Variables to S3
  run: |
    aws s3 cp .env s3://your-env-bucket/
    Create a GitHub Actions job to run database migrations using Flyway:    
    name: Migrate Database with Flyway               
  run: |
    flyway migrate -url=jdbc:mysql://your-rds-endpoint:3306/yourdb -user=yourusername -password=yourpassword
    Create a GitHub Actions job to update the ECS task definition
    name: Create New ECS Task Def Revision
  run: |
    aws ecs register-task-definition --family your-task-family --container-definitions file://path/to/container-definitions.json
    Create a job to restart the ECS Fargate service after deployment
    name: Restart ECS Fargate Service
  run: |
    aws ecs update-service --cluster your-cluster --service your-service --force-new-deployment
    Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how to automate the deployment of applications to AWS using GitHub Actions. It covers creating and managing AWS resources, Docker image builds, and basic database migrations.
